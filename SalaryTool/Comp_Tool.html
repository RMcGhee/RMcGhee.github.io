				<h3>About this app</h3>
				<p>
					This app is useful for general comparisons between cities. It is not designed to give
					financial advice to individual users. Because of the limitations of such a general tool,
					it should be noted that there are no guarantees, waranties, or claims of accuracy that
					constitute legal or financial advice. In order to better understand how each section
					is calculated, and what exactly that means, read the explanation box to the right
					of each graph. Any users looking for financial advice should consult with a certified
					financial planner before making any financial or legal decisions.

				<h2>Naive comparison</h2>
				<p>
					A naive comparison normalizes both salaries to a median cost of living.
					This comparison is weak because it assumes that all income is taken up
					by the cost of living, which is often not the case.<br><br> Example: Assume the
					cost of living in city A is $1.00 and the cost of living in city B is
					$2.00. If you earn $5.00 in city A, <b>naive</b> COL assesment shows you need
					to earn $10.00 in city B to have the same amount of disposable income.
					Simple math shows otherwise: if you earn $5.00 in city A, you only need a pay increase of
					$1.00 (20%) to live in city B with the same amount of disposable income ($4.00).
					Purchasing parity for like goods will determine how far that disposable
					income will go in each city. <br>Data sourced from expatistan.com, a crowd-sourced
					cost of living index. These values were then normalized to median U.S. values using
					data from Wolfram-Alpha.

				<h2>After Essentials</h2>
				<p>
					After essentials shows the amount of income left over after taxes,
					food, housing, insurance, and transportation needs have been met. The values
					used are for a single adult household, and will not be accurate for
					two-person plus households. Part of this data uses MIT's living wage data,
					part uses average state/local tax burdens from Tax Foundation (a conservative
					tax policy think tank) and part uses average effective
					federal tax rate, supplied by the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO). MIT's living
					wage calculations includes taxes on the amount required for a living wage, 
					so state/local taxes and federal taxes are calculated only on the income outside 
					of that amount. In particular, the average tax burden percentage is determined from 
					the raw income, but is only applied to income <b>after</b> the living wage 
					has been deducted. Canadian tax burdens calculated using a best fit line from
					average tax rates from Ernst &amp Young (multinational professional services firm).
					Canadian living wage data obtained from Statistics Canada's Market Basket Measure
					(Admittedly, not the best measure of COL) and calculating pre tax earnings.
			</div>
			<div id="ex_section2" class="explanation">
				<h2>Savings</h2>
				<p>
					Savings are calculated based on data from the previous section. Namely, yearly contribution 
					values are initially 25% of <b>after essentials</b> values. As well, the annual percentage
					rate is set to 7% initially. In depth analysis of savings/retirement plans are far beyond
					the scope of this tool, so take this with a boulder sized grain of salt, as every
					individual's situation is complex and nuanced. Interest in this graph compounds yearly,
					contributions are made at the end of the year, and the principle amount is $0.

				<h2>Cost of a House</h2>
				<p>
					In the first column is the median price of a house for each city. The following
					columns are the <b>yearly</b> payments required to service a loan of shown duration.
					The initial interest rate is 3.5%, 3.75%, and 4.0% fixed for the 10, 15, and 30 year
					loans respectively.
					House price data sourced from the National Association of Realtors, the Canadian Real
					Estate Association, Zillow (for Anchorage, Detroit, and Pittsburg). Average rate
